# Course Plan, Spring 2019

## Weekly blogs and collaboration

Students work on their weekly blog posts.

Students report issues and submit fixes to each other's blog. 


## `git` / GitHub exercises 

A __student survey__ to see what they know 

[Git intro activitiy](https://github.com/StoneyJackson/git-intro-activity) - students work in pairs (the person with 
more `git` experience should be the recorder, the person with less experience should do the actual exercise) 


[GitHub workflow activity](https://github.com/StoneyJackson/github-workflow-activity) - starts with the slides, then 
students work in groups of 2-__3__ (forks, branches, pull requests, pulling changes from upstream) 

## Build your own plugin workshop

Students work in groups of 2-__3__ to build a plugin for Firefox that they then contribute back to the community.
